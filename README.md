# 🎮 Guess The Number Game

A fun and tricky number guessing game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This is my first complete frontend project, combining basic to intermediate JavaScript logic, playful UI, and AI-assisted DOM design.

## 🔍 About the Game

**"Guess The Number"** challenges the player to guess a secret number between 1 and 100 within 5 attempts.  
But here’s the twist — the game dynamically provides **smart hints** using logic like:

- Prime number check 🧠  
- Perfect square detection 🔢  
- Divisibility by 2, 3, 5, 6 🔁  
- Palindromes 🔄  
- Digit relations (e.g., adjacent digits) 🧩  
- Closeness bar 📊 as visual feedback  
- Randomized hint options using arrays and shuffling 🎲

Each attempt gives you more context to guess smarter!
